# Read me before collecting news

1. Check existing apps on the device, think about which app(s) can be used to collect news (e.g. Browser, X, Reddit, Xiaohongshu, etc.)
2. Open the app, view recommended news or search for specific topic.
3. Record the information to results, including title, content, link (if exists).
